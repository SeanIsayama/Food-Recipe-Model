## Framing the Problem

In our previous data analysis project on, we investigated the relationship between the number of ingredients (#) and amount of calories from the recipes and reviews posted on the food.com dataset from 2008.

Our exploratory data analysis on this dataset can be found [here](https://seanisayama.github.io/Food-Recipe-Study/).

### Problem Identification

In this project, we will build on this relationship â€“ we will create a regression model to predict the amount of calories in a given recipe, as we discovered in our exloratory data analysis. 

Therefore, the response variable for this project will be the amount of calories (#), where we will use the Root Mean Squared Error (RSME) to evaluate our model. We chose to use the RSME instead of other suitable evaluation metrics (such as the coefficient of determination), as we concluded that RMSE is better than R-squared when evaluating how our model will perform to unseen or test data.
